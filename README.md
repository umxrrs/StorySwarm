# StorySwarm
---

**StorySwarm** is a Discord bot written in Go that enables collaborative storytelling in Discord servers. Users can start a story with a theme and tone, contribute sentences, propose branching plotlines with votes, and export stories as HTML pages. The bot uses sentiment analysis to ensure contributions match the story's tone.

## Features

- **Collaborative Storytelling**: Start a story with `!story start <theme> <tone>` and add contributions with `!add <text>`.
- **Story Branching**: Propose alternate plotlines with `!branch <text>` and vote using reactions.
- **Tone Consistency**: Simple keyword-based sentiment analysis ensures contributions match the story's tone (e.g., epic, spooky).
- **Web Export**: View completed stories at `http://<server>:8080/stories/<channel-id>`.
